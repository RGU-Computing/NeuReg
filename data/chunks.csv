Any institution who has already resolved these issues for themselves does not need to amend any planned hours for the advice below. In normal years, to derive planned hours for the year ahead, institutions look back at delivery in the current year and then use this information to update their course master files, which then feed through the planned hours for every student for the following year. It was clear in April 2020 that the in-year delivery for 2020/2021 academic year was not normal and in responding to issues relating to coronavirus (Coronavirus), it was too early for some funded institutions to determine how they should alter planned delivery for 2021/2022 academic year.",153

As funded institutions go through this funding year, they are now expected to consider how they need to adapt their planning of delivery so they can put in place more up to date planning assumptions for 2021/2022 academic year. This includes building on the knowledge of their education delivery to individual students during both the previous and current funding year. Any funded institution intending to 'roll over planning assumptions from 2018/2019 academic year' must, however, also take into account any funding audit advice received on their funding data for either 2018/2019 academic year, 2019/2020 academic year or 2020/2021 academic year.

For all ESFA provision, where funding is paid by ESFA to Local Authority(ies) (usually Local Authority(ies) maintained school provision), the Local Authority(ies) should usually be treated as the funding body for queries on this guidance. 6. The term 'institutions' is used to cover academies, schools, colleges and all other providers. The individual institution types will be used where the Funding guidance for young people applies only to that specific type of institution. Similarly 'students' is used as a constant reference to guidance applying to all students and pupils. 7. ESFA young people's funding is paid on a funding year starting 1 August and ending on 31 July (1 September to 31 August for academies).

For non-qualification activity to be eligible for funding, institutions must be able to evidence that they have incurred a cost in delivering the activity. For this reason, for example, homework after the end of the teaching day remains a non-fundable activity. In recording EEP hours as part of funding returns institutions must be able to evidence the costs they are incurring. For funding audit purposes, these costs should be reasonable and proportionate to the funding the EEP activity is generating. Additional funding audit attention will be made where the amount of EEP activity being funded makes up more than half the study programme funding.

Either the student or the student's tutor should have confirmed this in writing. 3. In addition, for full time programmes and part time programmes of more than 24 weeks in duration that are not distance learning programmes, a student must be considered to have withdrawn where they have not attended classes for at least 4 continuous weeks, excluding holidays.

Institutions must ensure that students are withdrawn from a programme where they have not attended classes for 4 continuous weeks, excluding holidays. Withdrawals must be actioned in a timely manner, and where a student has not been withdrawn but has been absent for more than 4 weeks, there must be auditable evidence of an intention to return. 6.

Students must also be correctly recorded as having transferred to another qualification, or withdrawn without transferring. 9. In all circumstances, the date of a student's withdrawal must be the last date of their actual attendance, not the date on which the student's record was flagged as withdrawn.

In these exceptional cases, the student need not be entered as withdrawn within the usual timescales. If the student fails to return, the withdrawal date must be the last date of attendance. 11. ESFA does not expect student withdrawals to occur in a systematic pattern.

Q1 If a student is studying 4 AS level learning aims over one year starting in September and withdraws from one of them after 5 weeks, may funding be recorded all year for the withdrawn learning aim? A1 No. If the student withdraws from a learning aim before they meet the qualifying period of the study programme, the institution must exclude the hours for the withdrawn qualification from the total hours for the year. In reviewing the planned hours the institution may include planned hours for other activity that is planned to displace the hours lost by the student withdrawal from the initial AS level.

A2 If a student is a full time student after the funding qualifying start period they remain a full time student for statistical and funding purposes for the whole year. Q3 What dates are used to determine a student's study programme qualifying period for funding purposes? A3 This is determined using the student's earliest learning aim start date and latest learning aim planned end date. Q4 If a student stops attending class with no notification to the institution, when is the date of withdrawal? A4 The date of the last attendance on the learning aim is the date of withdrawal. This should be found in the class register. Q5 If a student stops attending classes and a member of college staff telephones the student to discuss his or her learning progress, can this be counted as guided learning and be deemed the date of withdrawal?",187

Q7 A student on a one-year learning aim stops attending at Easter to revise at home yet turns up and sits the examination in early June. When is the date of withdrawal? A7 Early June.

Q9 If a student completes the first year of a 2-year programme and then fails to return for the second year, can the institution record a funding value for the second year? A9 No. The student must meet the start criteria for each separate funding year. Q10 For traineeships where the student achieves an early progression either into sustainable employment, full time education, other training or an apprenticeship, how should this be treated for funding retention purposes? A10 Where the outcome meets the definition of successful progression from a traineeship then the institution must treat the student as completed on their Individualised Learner Record data return so the student is treated as retained for funding purposes. If the traineeship is completed within the first 6 weeks, the institution must revise the planned hours to the planned hours for the student's actual period of attendance as set out in the section 'Recording planned hours'.",186

Most students leave in the summer as soon as they have completed either their last exam or handed in their last marked assignment for the year. Q12 If a young person withdraws from just one learning aim in their study programme within the first 6 weeks of their programme during the funding year, does the institution have to change the planned hours? A12 Yes, the institution must update the planned hours to remove all of the hours for the aim from the total. This rule applies regardless of the original length of the study programme or the funding band of the student. If excluding the hours already delivered within the first 6 weeks would make a material difference to the student's funding band, institutions can include just the hours that they have already delivered in the planned hours.",193

A13 You must set and adjust the planned hours for a student's study programme in each funded year of their programme. No planned hours or start period completion rolls over from one funding year to the next. When the student's programme crosses into a new funding year, for the purposes of recording planned hours you treat them the same as a new start. This means that the earliest possible start date for every funding year is always 1 August. Q14 When a student continues a programme from the previous year and the first date of attendance is after 1 August (for example, due to summer holiday arrangements), what date is used for calculating the planned hours? A14 Institutions must use the student's first date of attendance for learning activity to calculate the 6 week period for determining planned hours. The number of planned hours a student may study should not be greater than 40 hours per week (and for example, for those who cease studying after 5 weeks the maximum planned hours will be 200).",200

A15 A student should only be in receipt of one ESFA type of funding at any one time at any individual funded (or their financially related) institution. If a student is recorded as having successfully completed a study programme early and is then transferred onto an Apprenticeship programme at the same institution, the institution must make sure it is not drawing down two sources of ESFA funding for the same period of time. In determining what constitutes early completion our advice is to review students who complete before the equivalent of the start period needed to qualify for funding. For full time students this would be those students completing their 16 to 19 funding study programmes more than 6 weeks early and for shorter part time students more than two weeks early.",170

On a similar basis, providers must not record any planned hours for any study programme (including traineeships) period that overlaps with Apprenticeship funding, either at the same institution or a financially related one. When students withdraw from study programmes to start an Apprenticeship programme, providers must adjust their planned hours so no planned hours are claimed after the Apprenticeship programme starts. By reducing planned hours, providers will avoid the risk of claiming double funding and the effect on the retention factor will be proportionally smaller due to the lower funding band.",124

We are content that in these circumstances planned hours can be reduced even after the initial 6-week start period has passed as this maybe a much easier calculation than assessing the impact of the funding overlap on Apprenticeship funding. Q16 When a student withdraws from their entire study programme before they meet the funding start criteria do their planned hours need adjustment? A No. When a student withdraws from all their learning aims, and therefore withdraws from their whole programme, as long as they have not met the criteria to count as a funded start then providers do not need to change the planned hours. This can be checked by using the 16 to 19 funding funding claim report that only lists students who have met their relevant funding start criteria.",189
