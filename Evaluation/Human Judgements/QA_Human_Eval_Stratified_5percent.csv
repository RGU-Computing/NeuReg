inferential_oneshot_funding-agreements-and-conditi-p12-14-b216b423_1752248010_986054b2,inferential,one_shot,What implications does ESFA attaching conditions related to charges to students have on local authorities' school provision management?,"By attaching conditions related to charges to students on its young people's funding, ESFA indirectly influences how local authorities manage their maintained school provision. These conditions likely necessitate adjustments in how local authorities allocate budgets and implement financial policies for schools under their jurisdiction. Specifically, local authorities must ensure that any charges imposed on students for education and training provision comply with ESFA's guidelines. This could involve revising existing financial models or developing new strategies to maintain compliance with ESFA's funding agreements and avoid jeopardizing future funding.","Funding agreements and conditions 15. ESFA will enter into grant agreements or contracts for services with individual institutions paid directly by ESFA and with each Local Authority(ies) for their maintained school provision. These funding agreements will set out the funds that ESFA has agreed to pay for the education and training provision for young people expected in return for that funding. These include ESFA conditions in respect of charges to students for their provision. The separate condition of funding that applies to all provision in respect of the delivery of English and mathematics within study programmes is set out in Annex D. To assist institutions in planning to meet the condition of funding, ESFA have issued detailed guidance on the condition of funding. Funding conditions in respect of charges to students 16.

In contrast, their role in assisting institution staff with evidential issues aims at reducing the workload involved in resolving any problems related to evidence for the current funding year, thereby providing more direct support and guidance to institutions. While both roles aim to streamline and improve the efficiency of the funding audit process, auditor discretion focuses on the initial verification stage, and assistance with evidential issues targets ongoing support throughout the funding year.","Advice to funding auditors only 6.

This preparation is especially crucial during periods of social distancing when traditional activities might be replaced with substitute ones.

Consequently, this reduces the risk of encountering funding audit issues later in the funding year by ensuring that the substitute activities and their documentation align with funding requirements.","If planned funded activity becomes impossible to deliver due to local social distancing requirements or other challenges, we expect institutions to arrange substitute activities. For example, where external work experience becomes impossible then students should be offered alternative arrangements that help them meet their original study programme objectives. The advice above, together with the additional advice we have already given in Annex B on evidencing planned hours to funding auditors, may also help in planning hours for students in these current difficult circumstances and avoiding any funding audit issues later in the funding year.","1. activity → has_reason → social_distancing_requirements

This separation ensures that the specific conditions, goals, and regulatory requirements unique to apprenticeship programs can be addressed more effectively without conflict with the broader framework of subcontracted provision guidance.","6: Subcontracting Subcontracted provision: Subcontracted provision, including franchised or partnership provision, is learning provision that is delivered with the involvement of a third party and all institutions using third parties to deliver any of their funded provision must follow the published guidance in Sub-Contracting funding rules for ESFA funded Post 16 funding (Excluding Apprenticeships). To assist all funded institutions the specific additional subcontracting requirements that apply to 16 to 19 funding funding arrangements are set out in 16 to 19 funding Annex of that document. That advice is repeated below and replaces the earlier draft advice we published in this book before the full subcontracting advice document was made available on the website to our funded institution.

This contrasts with institutions not operating under ESFA's advice which might not have an explicit expectation to involve these external entities during the enrolment process. This involvement ensures that all necessary discussions and considerations regarding funding and educational continuity take place, reflecting a more community-oriented approach for institutions following ESFA guidelines.","Students under 16 48. There is a single date when young people can legally leave school in England, which is the last Friday in June for those people who have completed year 11.

Since some students might not start their academic activities right on August 1 due to summer holidays or other reasons, using the first date of actual attendance allows institutions to adjust and set realistic planned hours. This approach ensures that all students have their educational workload calculated from when they truly begin engaging in learning activities, thereby providing a more accurate framework for managing study time and expectations within the allowable maximums.","Q13 When does the first six weeks for setting and adjusting planned hours start for students who started their programme in the previous funding year? A13 You must set and adjust the planned hours for a student's study programme in each funded year of their programme. No planned hours or start period completion rolls over from one funding year to the next. When the student's programme crosses into a new funding year, for the purposes of recording planned hours you treat them the same as a new start. This means that the earliest possible start date for every funding year is always 1 August. Q14 When a student continues a programme from the previous year and the first date of attendance is after 1 August (for example, due to summer holiday arrangements), what date is used for calculating the planned hours? A14 Institutions must use the student's first date of attendance for learning activity to calculate the 6 week period for determining planned hours. The number of planned hours a student may study should not be greater than 40 hours per week (and for example, for those who cease studying after 5 weeks the maximum planned hours will be 200).","1. student_programme → crosses_into → new_funding_year

Electronic signatures can be anything from a check box to a handwritten signature captured on a device, primarily serving the purpose of signifying intent. Digital signatures, on the other hand, include an added layer of security by incorporating encryption - described as a digital fingerprint. This digital fingerprint secures the document by making it non-refutable and ensures that it cannot be tampered with, thus providing a higher level of security compared to standard electronic signatures.","An electronic signature is defined as any electronic symbol or process that is associated with any record or document where there is an intention to sign the document by any party involved. An electronic signature can be anything from a check box to a signature. A digital signature is where a document with an electronic signature is secured by a process making it non-refutable. It's a digital fingerprint which captures the act of signing by applying security to a document. Usually documents which have a digital signature embedded are extremely secure and cannot be accessed or amended easily. 137. Where an electronic or digital signature is being held, from any party for any reason, you must ensure it is non-refutable, this includes the definitions of both wet and dry signatures. Systems and processes must be in place to assure to us the original signature has not been altered.

This might encourage institutions to design more structured, curriculum-focused interventions or resources rather than relying on general or administrative assistance to support students' learning processes.","A5 No. Learning must be specific to the course being studied. The telephone call described here is assistance of a general nature and is not counted for planned hours purposes. Q6 If a student stops attending classes and some time later the student is persuaded to attend the institution to discuss his or her learning attendance, can this be counted as planned hours learning and be deemed the date of withdrawal? A6 No. As in the previous answer, learning must be specific to the course being studied. The meeting described here is assistance of a general and administrative nature. Q7 A student on a one-year learning aim stops attending at Easter to revise at home yet turns up and sits the examination in early June. When is the date of withdrawal? A7 Early June. Sitting the examination is assessment of the student's achievement and will count as learning.

For a student who ceases studying after 5 weeks, the maximum allowed planned hours is capped at 200, aligning with a maximum of 40 hours per week. In contrast, for a student who continues studying beyond the initial six-week adjustment period, while their weekly hours may still not exceed 40 hours per week, their cumulative allowed planned hours can extend beyond this initial cap as they continue their studies in adherence with ongoing assessments and adjustments made by their institution.","Q13 When does the first six weeks for setting and adjusting planned hours start for students who started their programme in the previous funding year? A13 You must set and adjust the planned hours for a student's study programme in each funded year of their programme. No planned hours or start period completion rolls over from one funding year to the next. When the student's programme crosses into a new funding year, for the purposes of recording planned hours you treat them the same as a new start. This means that the earliest possible start date for every funding year is always 1 August. Q14 When a student continues a programme from the previous year and the first date of attendance is after 1 August (for example, due to summer holiday arrangements), what date is used for calculating the planned hours? A14 Institutions must use the student's first date of attendance for learning activity to calculate the 6 week period for determining planned hours. The number of planned hours a student may study should not be greater than 40 hours per week (and for example, for those who cease studying after 5 weeks the maximum planned hours will be 200).","1. student_programme → crosses_into → new_funding_year

These methods cater to the challenges of assessing participation without physical presence. Traditional in-person sessions, however, rely on physical attendance registers or direct observation by tutors to evidence student participation. The main difference lies in the nature of evidence collected: digital footprints versus physical or observational evidence.","All institutions should consider the benefits of a good register system to help them to monitor student attendance and progress. This will also support accurate data returns and funding claims. Register systems need to be proportionate in delivering benefits to institutions that offset the costs involved in running these systems and appropriate to the mode of delivery. ESFA offers no advice or preference on types of systems, which may be either paper-based or electronic, or a mixture of such systems. Advice on evidencing non face-to-face delivery is in Annex C paragraph 4 which states a withdrawn student who cannot attend registered sessions would be one failing to meet the following guidance on participation or contact: receipt of work or projects by the tutor (electronic or hard copy) log-on evidence to learning materials given to students by the institution ‚Ä¢ communication with the tutor that indicated that the student was still active on their learning aim, including planned contacts 132.

It is recognised that providers delivering training and/or recruiting learners during the coronavirus (Coronavirus) pandemic will experience difficulty in obtaining learner and employer wet signatures. Where providers do not have systems and processes in place for electronic/digital signatures, during the coronavirus (Coronavirus) restrictions, we will allow confirmation/evidence to be obtained through email as detailed below. 140.

This involves capturing the exact date when the student last participated in academic activities.,"Institutions must record student withdrawal dates promptly and accurately in order to reflect the last date of actual recorded attendance. Institutions must record all student withdrawals in the Individualised Learner Record or school census. 8. Institutions must not record withdrawn students as having completed their course, and they are not usually recorded as achieved students. Students must also be correctly recorded as having transferred to another qualification, or withdrawn without transferring. 9. In all circumstances, the date of a student's withdrawal must be the last date of their actual attendance, not the date on which the student's record was flagged as withdrawn. While students may not be classified as withdrawn until 4 weeks have elapsed since their last attendance, or for open and distance learning since the missed contact, the date of withdrawal must still be recorded as the date of last actual participation.","1. institution → has_legal_duty → record_withdrawal_dates

The new document then starts its effect from a specified date, and both the old and new documents must be held alongside each other. This process guarantees that there is clear evidence of when each version of the document became effective, maintaining their integrity and non-refutability.","An electronic signature is defined as any electronic symbol or process that is associated with any record or document where there is an intention to sign the document by any party involved. An electronic signature can be anything from a check box to a signature. A digital signature is where a document with an electronic signature is secured by a process making it non-refutable. It's a digital fingerprint which captures the act of signing by applying security to a document. Usually documents which have a digital signature embedded are extremely secure and cannot be accessed or amended easily. 137. Where an electronic or digital signature is being held, from any party for any reason, you must ensure it is non-refutable, this includes the definitions of both wet and dry signatures. Systems and processes must be in place to assure to us the original signature has not been altered. Where any document needs to be renewed, and a new signature taken, it must be clear from when the new document takes affect and both must be held.

This autonomy is granted based on the college's ability to meet the educational requirements set by ESFA. In contrast, while the same advice applies to schools and academies placing students in their sixth forms earlier than usual, it implies that these institutions follow similar guidelines but within a framework that typically requires navigating additional administrative protocols inherent in school systems.","ESFA funds children who are currently electively home educated (EHE) who attend general further education (Further Education) and sixth form colleges. EHE children who attend schools and academies are not eligible for ESFA young people's funding. You can find more information in the Funding rates and formula guide. 53. Colleges may claim ESFA young people's funding for children of compulsory school age who have completed their statutory education, have achieved qualifications at least equivalent to a full level 2, and who want to enrol on a level 3 course. Colleges do not need to seek approval from ESFA, as we will count these students for lagged funding purposes. This advice also applies to schools and academies placing students in their sixth forms earlier than usual. 54. In exceptional circumstances, for example, students arriving in the UK for the first time during school year 11, ESFA will consider provision for individual students of compulsory school age to be eligible for ESFA young people's funding in colleges. Groups of students would not be eligible for funding, since by inference such circumstances are unlikely to be exceptional.","1. esfa → funds → ehe_children_further_education

This policy promotes integrity in the funding process by ensuring that only eligible students benefit from the funding, thus preventing misuse of funds and enabling more precise allocation of resources according to actual eligibility."," The institution itself will normally be registered with the awarding body for the core qualification being studied and students must be registered with the awarding body in order to be eligible for ESFA funding.
