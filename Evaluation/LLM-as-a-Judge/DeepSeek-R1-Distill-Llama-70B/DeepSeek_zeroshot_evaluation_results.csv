This indicates a general outlook towards irregularities in withdrawal rates being scrutinized. On the other hand, when it comes to courses exhibiting a high number of withdrawals shortly after meeting funding start criteria or other key dates, ESFA's expectation shifts towards institutions and funding auditors paying special attention to attendance records and associated management controls.

For institutions, this could signal the need for a thorough evaluation of attendance records and management controls of affected courses. Such patterns might suggest gaps in how well these institutions are monitoring enrollment against funding criteria or identifying issues that lead to high dropout rates.

Institutions must have comprehensive evidence of the student's circumstances and intentions to return, which includes notifications or assessments from medical advisers. When a student with mental ill-health fails to return, this stored evidence becomes crucial for determining the withdrawal date as the last date of attendance without penalizing the student prematurely.

Since neither paid employment nor paid work experience can typically be recorded as fundable planned EEP hours due to their nature of compensation, an institution's obligation to provide evidence according to specific cost definitions means they must diligently demonstrate how any included activity incurs eligible costs.

Since start dates for funding are determined by when a student's learning aim begins, any significant alterations could result in adjustments to these start dates. Consequently, the school census, which collects data from academies, may report different start dates or learning aims. This information would then be used to determine whether and when funding should be recorded, potentially affecting both the timing and amount of funding distributed.
